# Wavlake Docs

Welcome to the Wavlake documentation site! This is a work in progress.



## FAQ

### Player

#### How does Player work?

Like any music player! Choose the track you want to play and it will start playing.

The special thing about the Wavlake Player is you can interact with the artists through Boosts and Messages.

#### What is a Boost?

A Boost is a small bitcoin payment that goes to the creator of the track. Boosts are denominated in satoshis, or sats, which is equal to 0.00000001 bitcoin.

#### OK then, what is a Message?

A Message can be anything you want to communicate to the artist! Words, emojis, non-sensical dialogue are all fair game. Every Message requires a minimum Boost to send.

#### Can I change my default Boost amount?

Yes. You can change this setting in your [Preferences](https://player.wavlake.com/preferences).



### Studio

#### What is Studio?

Studio is a tool for artists and creators to upload and share audio with listeners through Wavlake Player or other [Podcasting 2.0](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/podcasting2.0.md) compatible applications (also see [v4v](https://value4value.info/)).

#### Where is my content stored?

All content is stored in a cloud distribution network managed by Wavlake.

#### Who can access my content?

Anyone with the public link to your content can access it. These links are included in the public RSS feeds we publish for every release. This RSS feed link is available on every release page in Wavlake Player via the RSS icon ([example feed](https://player.wavlake.com/feed/891c9ffe-1e78-4b07-a75e-7283629fb127) for [album](https://player.wavlake.com/album/891c9ffe-1e78-4b07-a75e-7283629fb127) shown below). Our RSS feeds adhere to the [Podcasting 2.0 spec](https://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/podcasting2.0.md).

#### Why would you let anyone listen to my content for free?

We believe an open base layer for content will be more beneficial for artists and listeners in the long run. By allowing payments to creators from anyone in the world over the internet using bitcoin, we think paywalls will become a thing of the past.

### Fees

#### How much does Wavlake collect in fees from boosts?

Wavlake takes 10% from every track boost and message boost. The exact amount can be viewed per boost/message in the [Activity](https://studio.wavlake.com/stats) section in Studio.

_Coming soon: stats for fans_

#### Are there any fees for funding or withdrawals?

No. The only fees for funding and withdrawals are those required for the Lightning transaction.
